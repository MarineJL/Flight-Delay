# :airplane:   Flight Delay Forecast  

![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-python-html-blue.svg)

Based on the database available on https://www.transtats.bts.gov/, here is an app to check if your next flight will be delayed ! :clock9:

> This project is part of the Data Scientist track on OpenClassrooms. The objective is to create a user-friendly interface where the flight delay is computed when a user enter his flight details.

## :detective:  Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis 

Let's clean the data set and do a first exporatory analysis to check what's the data look like. You can find the results in the ExploratoryAnalysis file

## :computer:  Machine Learning

In the file MachineLearning, you can find different algorithms applied to the dataset
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regressin
- Ridge
- Lasso
- Elastic Net

## :rocket:  API

Once the best algorithm has been selected, it's time to create the API. HTML template can be found in the templates folder. 

We're done ! :zap::airplane: https://projet4-marine.herokuapp.com :airplane::zap:
